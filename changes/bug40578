  o Major bugfixes (bridges):
    - Add a new config option FetchBridgeDescsJIT to fetch bridge
      descriptors "just in time" for the bridges that Tor plans to
      use. Now if you have a large bridge list (such as when using
      Tor Browser's built-in bridges) or you are using transports like
      Snowflake where each descriptor fetch is an expensive operation,
      you will only reach out to the bridges whose descriptors you
      actually need. Fixes bug 40578; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.
