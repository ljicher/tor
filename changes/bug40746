  o Minor bugfixes (bridge users):
    - When choosing a bridge to fetch directory info from, only select
      from among bridges whose descriptors we already have. In theory we
      don't need the bridge's descriptor to ask it for directory info,
      but in practice the code that does the fetching assumes we do. This
      mistake only slows down bootstrap, but shouldn't prevent it. Fixes
      bug 40746; bugfix on 0.3.0.3-alpha.
